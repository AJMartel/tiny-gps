Tiny-GPS I²C interface

by Stefan Tomanek <stefan@pico.ruhr.de>

Using this software, your handy little ATTiny2313 starts reading NMEA sentences
from a serial GPS receiver connected to its RXD pin. These sentences are
interpreted and stored in RAM, where the data can be accessed via the I²C/TWI
bus connected to the SCL (PB7) and SDA (PB5) pins.

Currently, only the GPGGA and GPRMC sentences are interpreted; the data is
accessible in the following format (see nmea_data_t in nmea.h):

byte	content
0	bit flags (from lsb to msb):
	0 NMEA signal is valid (1<<NMEA_RMC_FLAGS_STATUS_OK)
	1 latitude alignment North (1<<NMEA_RMC_FLAGS_LAT_NORTH)
	2 longitude alignment East (1<<NMEA_RMC_FLAGS_LON_EAST)

1	day
2	month
3	year (2 digits)
4	hour
5	minute
6	second
7	latitude degrees
8	latitude minutes
9/10	latitude fractions of a minute, BCD format
11	longitude degrees
12	longitude minutes
13/14	longitude fractions of a minute, BCD format
15/16	altitude in m (signed, 16 bit)
17	altitude fractions of metres, BCD format
18	signal quality
19	number of satellites used

The default I²C address is 0x11 and can be changed by editing 'config.h'.

The controller polls the GPS receiver with the baud rate of 9600 bps, which is
also configurable.

To enable reliable TWI communication at 400kHz, the controller has to be clocked at
8 MHz (using the internal RC oscillator is fine).
